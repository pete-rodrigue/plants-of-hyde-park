_A few thoughts on this project_<br/><br/>
What civic issue does this address? *<br/><br/>

They say your innovations should emerge from problems you know well. That is why, as a recreational forager, I chose to make this map. I've often thought, "I wish there were a guide to my neighborhood’s edible plants, something I could consult without having to ride metro for two hours to take a guided plant walk in a distant suburb." 
<br/><br/>
This guide is built for that purpose: to offer people reference to a handful of edible plants in Hyde Park, without having to travel hours for a guided tour. 
<br/><br/>
How is local plant knowledge a civic issue?
<br/><br/>
Learning about the wonders of humble neighborhood plants helps people develop a deeper appreciation for the place they live. Local plant knowledge helps us connect with the history of a place, especially indigenous history, which affords plants proper respect.
<br/><br/>
A man who appreciates the imperfect intricacies and rich diversity among so-called weeds is cultivating humility, a sense of history, and a more profound love of beauty. He is less likely to wield gasoline mowers, trimmers and whackers with feverous abandon, and maybe less likely to yell at his family, or hasten the planet’s destruction, or otherwise tear at the fabric of communal life. Good foragers make good neighbors.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Who is your core user? *
<br/><br/>
I am the core user, as well as my friends in Hyde Park. I’m not sure how I’d raise awareness about it outside of that group. But I’m thinking of leading a plant walk for some friends this summer. Maybe folks will add their own plants, or use the app as a reference. For a more scaled, but more anonymous tool, people can use the website FallingFruit.org. 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>


What existing dataset(s) did you use? *
<br/><br/>
I compiled these descriptions and images, with help from Wikipedia, as well as my mom, a landscape architect with an encyclopedic knowledge of plants and the patience to answer dozens of texts asking, “What is this?”
<br/><br/>
Briefly describe the technologies you used *
(ie language, database, hosting, and any design frameworks you used)
<br/><br/>
The map and about page are hosted on GitHub pages; both were written using HTML and javascript. The map is driven by Leaflet. People can contribute to the map using a Google form, which is feeds a Google sheet. A Sheety API updates the map when the Google Sheet changes. The photos are hosted within my Google Drive. The styling for the about page is based on a CSS template called workshop from ColorLib. The stars background for the map was adopted from a CodePen by user WebSonick.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Identify 2-3 metrics you would use to assess the app’s impact *
<br/><br/>
This app/journal is mostly for me, but soft “metrics” include: (1) How many good conversations about plants and local history do I have with friends who otherwise might not have thought about this stuff? (2) How many new plants do I learn? 
<br/><br/>
You get out of a journal what you put into it.
<br/><br/>
I’m also going to set up a Google Analytics tag for the map, just to see how many people visit. 
<br/><br/>
On a separate note, this project inspired me to write a nice email to facilities to thank them for doing such a nice job.
